# Classification_Algo_sklearn_toy_datsets
This contains various Classification models which can be used. Implemented using sklearn. 

Unlike regression where aim is to predict a continuous number, here we do classification to predict a category. Classification models      ->linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM 
-> Nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.

Here we would try to implement the following machine learning algorithms.

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Kernel SVM
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree Classification
Random Forest Classification
