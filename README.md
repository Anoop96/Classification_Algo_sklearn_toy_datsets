# Classification_Algo_sklearn_toy_datsets
This contains various Classification models which can be used. Implemented using sklearn. 

Unlike regression where aim is to predict a continuous number, here we do classification to predict a category. Classification models      ->linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM 
-> Nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.

Here we would try to implement the following machine learning algorithms.
Given Age and Salary whether or not a purson will purchase a car. Lets see which among the below model performs the best.
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Kernel SVM
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree Classification
Random Forest Classification


After testing the implementation on these algorithms. We implemented UCI- Breast cancer Dataset to find out the which model performs the best for predicting the Tumor is Malignant or benign.
